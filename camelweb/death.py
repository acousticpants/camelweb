shoot = ("""
Quick on the draw you yank out your blaster and fire.
His billowing clown suit obscures his body, ruining 
your aim. Your laser bolt pierces through his puffy 
striped sleeve but leaves him unharmed. The Gothon flies
into a rage at the damage you have done to his beautiful
costume. He fires repeatedly at you until your face melts
off and you are dead. He kneels by your smoking body and
delicately tugs a piece of flesh from your neck. After a
tentative lick at hunk of neck-flesh, he decides it is 
acceptable and proceeds to devour the rest of your body.

dodge = ("""
Like a ninja you begin weaving and side-stepping around
around the confused Gothon, who tries to aim but fires
wildly. In the middle of a particular ambitious dodge
you slip, sending you headlong into the neo-steel wall
of the corridor. You pass out. The Gothon stomps on your
head and begins eating you from the neck down.

The lock buzzes one last time and then you hear a sickening
melting sound as the mechanism is fused together. 
You sit on the floor legs crossed, looking down. 
As the Gothons send in a final volley of halo rockets to 
destroy your ship, you rest your head in your and exhale.

throw = ("""
With startled nerves you toss the bomb at the Gothons
and leap for the door. In mid air a hidden Gothon shoots
you in the spine and you crumple to the floor, spasming 
and burning. The Gothons begin trying to disarm the bomb.
You take some satisfaction with your last breaths as you
contemplate their likely detonation.

wrongpod = ("""
You vault into the pod and flip the eject switch.
The pod escapes out into the void of space, then implodes
as the hull ruptures, crushing your body into bright red
jelly.
